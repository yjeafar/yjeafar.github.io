                  I became a software engineer after going to college unsure of what to do. I kind of had a feeling I was going to do engineering, however I knew that I didn't
                  want to do mechanical or electrical. I never really know what coding was until I was introduced to it from a friend of mine. After taking my first Computer 
                  Science class my freshman year, I knew right away that this was someting I wanted to do for the rest of my life (until I retire on a farm of course). 
                </p>
                  I love acquiring new skills, and I am a huge user of FOSS. In my spare time, I enjoy fishing, amateur star gazing
                (when I can actually setup my telescope properly), hiking, playing video games, traveling as much as I can, and setting up aquariums
