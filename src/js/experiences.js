              I started school knowing I would do engineering but not knowing what exactly. Coming from a Middle Eastern background and with my
              parents being first generation immigrants without a whole lot of knowledge about computers, I didn't consider Software Engineering
              at first. After some time, I took a CIS class, and knew this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I joined the Insitute
              of Software Engineers and volunteered to help at Hackathons and taught kids in low privillage areas to code through Google Code Corps.
              I graduated with a 3.80 GPA and was on the dean's list for multiple consecutive semesters.

                      I started at Blue Cross after getting offered an internship while I was still in school. At the time, they had me work on pages that would generate
                      reports, used to help Underwriters complete settlements quicker.

                    <li>
                      I completed this assignment (created 5 reports users can select from) using Angular 7.0 and C# 4.3, with Entity Framework to help with the SQL statements.

                        <li>
                          I did both the front and back end (design, implelmentation, and testing) using a Domain Driven Design architecture.

                        <li>
                          This assignmnet helped the team start getting off of applications 10+ years old that were run as a command line application.

                        <li>
                          Some new features I added were: added a comment section on our application, new pages to display/update/delete customer information,

                    <li>
                      DTE Energy is a public utility company that provides gas and water to many Michiganders as well as to other states.
                  </li>
                    <li>
                      When first starting at DTE, they recently switched billing systems so there were now many lights and traffic signals
                      that they were not in the new system.
                  </li>
                    <li>
                      My main objective was to work on the traffic signals as there had been excel files with 2 million+ records in them with
                      wodden poles and their coordinates.
                  </li>
                    <li>
                      With another intern, we worked with Python using Anaconda to clean up the data, then exported the file to SQL and I ran
                      queries to cross reference the coordinates of the pole with what was currently in our system.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                          I ended up finding about $70,000 in annual revenue that we weren't billing for. We had teams go out and check
                          and they located some of the lights that were not in the system
                      </li>
                      </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      DTE offered me my spot back after my internship at BCBSM, and I accepted so I could help see this project to the end. When I came
                      back, I looked for more traffic lights, then moved onto street lights.
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                          I found about $50,000 in annual revenue from street lights by working with SQL and doing a similar process to what I did with the traffic signals.

                      This was my first internship working with Web Development and I was tasked with helping create a website for the employees to
                      help streamline the hiring process

                    <li>
                      The application would automatically generate a contract with the correct information, and was downloadable as pdf

                    <li>
                      I added charts, tables, filtered data, etc and once I learned what I was doing I moved onto production
                      changes. We used Angular 6, with C# for the backend, SQL, and Entity Framework to incorpoate direct SQL into our backend

                    <li>
                      I worked on parts that helped show the recruiter important information about the client, as well as work on creating new APIs for other

                    <li>
                      We did weekly/biweekly code reviews and showcased the changes we made during the Sprint meetings. We used Scrum to keep track of our progress
