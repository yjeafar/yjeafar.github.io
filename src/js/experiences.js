              I started school knowing I would do engineering but not knowing what exactly. Coming from a Middle Eastern background and with my
              parents being first generation immigrants without a whole lot of knowledge about computers, I didn't really consider Software Engineering.
              During my second semester, I took a CIS class and right away knew this was what I wanted to do for the rest of my life. I joined the Institute
              of Software Engineers and volunteered to help at Hackathons. I also was apart of Google Code Corps, where I helped teach kids in low privilege
              areas about coding. I graduated with a 3.80 GPA and was on the dean's list for multiple consecutive semesters.

                      As a Business System Developer, my tasks varied by sprint. One sprint I could be working on server migrations with Chef, the next I could
                      be working on a production issue, and the next I could be adding new functionality or fixing existing issues in our applications.

                      Our main application helped so finance could generate ledgers that were used in reporting to the company and agencies. The process intook 
                      data from the different agencies we work with and transformed the data, put it into our database, and allowed for finance and other business 
                      sectors of our company to use it. 
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          The application took the JSON file and based on configurations specified in the YAML file, it would put the corresponding column in the 
                          targeted column in the database.

                          This application was written in Angular, currently using version 14, .Net Core 3.1, and Sql Server (2016). Github with the repos

                        Some other things I have created include new tables, adding foriegn and unique key indexes to the tables, created many different stored procedures, 
                        new async processes to run alongside other processes we currently have, implement a waitRetry method for the async processes, and much more

                      During my time here, I have really felt myself grow from a junior to a more mid level role, as I found myself becoming the one people come to

                      DTE Energy is a public utility company that provides gas and electricity to over 2 million Michiganders.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      When I started at DTE, they recently switched billing systems, so there were many lights and traffic signals
                      unaccounted for in the new system
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      My main objective was to work on finding traffic signals, as there had been excel files with 2 million+ records in them with
                      wooden poles and their coordinates
                    </li>
                    <li>
                      With another intern, we worked with Python using Anaconda to clean up the data, then exported the file to SQL and I ran
                      queries to cross reference the coordinates of the pole with what was currently in our system
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          I ended up finding about $70,000 in annual revenue that DTE wasn't billing for. We had teams go out and check
                          and they verified the lights/signals in the field that were not in the system
                        </li>
                      </ul>

                    <li>
                      DTE offered to extend my internship after I completed my internship at BCBSM, and I accepted
                      <ul>
                        <li>
                          I found about $50,000 in annual revenue from street lights by working with SQL and doing a similar process to what I did with the traffic signals
