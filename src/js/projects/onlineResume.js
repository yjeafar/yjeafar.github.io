        This application that you are currently viewing was brainstormed and created by me. Of course, I went through many different designs before finally settling on
        one that I was happy with. I completed this project from scratch using React, with EmailJs for the email section in the contact me form, Material UI
        to make it look pretty, and boostrap for fluidity. I hope you like it, if you have any questions, comments, or recommendations, please leave me a message below! I'm 
        always happy to hear feedback and to continuously improve! <span role="img" aria-label="Smiling Emoji">ðŸ˜„</span>
