My portfolio
This is a simple react app I created to make my personal website. This website includes information about me and projects I am currently work on, 
as well as previous employment, education, etc. It also gives a way for the user to contact me. 

It's a pretty straight forward personal website that I tried to make different than others. If you'd like to run it locally, clone the repo 
and cd into the website folder then run npm start. I will continue to add to this website as I move forward in my life and in my professional career.

Thanks for taking the time to look at it!
