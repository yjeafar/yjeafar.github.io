        <p>
          I am a currently working as an Application Developer where I help create full stack websites at Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan.
          After interning for them in Summer of 2019, they brought me on board to be a full time employee in January 2020. I spend most of my days 
          reading or playing with new technologies, fishing, or amateur stargazing. I enjoy helping out anywhere I could and being part of any 
          community I can.
          Make it funny too!
